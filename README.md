# Random Password Generator

Maybe I'm an API Samurai considering the fact that ever since I discovered [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com), I have been keen to create projects using their APIs. You can have a look at one I've already completed at [this site](https://markuptitan.github.io/random_quotes-generator). This time, though, I'm using a password generator API. As of this commit, the real work hasn't started yet, but after the completion of this project, I aim to have these:

### 1. **A live HTML/CSS environment:**

Honestly, I am an even bigger fan of `npm` packages, and I came across this password generator: [generate-password](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generate-password), which has a limitation I wouldn't like to discuss here (this is just fancy English; the library doesn't support web environments). However, this project uses a direct web environment, meaning you are easily started by a few clicks and strokes.

### 2. **Password Generation:**

The heart of this project is a random password generator powered by the API from [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com). Users can generate a password based on their desired length and can even exclude numbers or special characters if they choose to. No more struggling to come up with a strong password on your own.

### 3. **Password Strength Indicator:**

We understand that not all passwords are created equal. That’s why this project will include a password strength indicator, letting users know whether their generated password is weak, medium, or strong. It’s all about giving you the power of choice, but with a little nudge in the right direction.

### 4. **Dark Theme:**

In a world where dark themes are a necessity rather than a luxury, this project will not be left behind. We’ll be implementing a sleek, modern dark theme that users can toggle on and off. Your eyes will thank you during those late-night password-generating sessions.

### 5. **Theme Toggle:**

A theme toggle switch will be a key feature, allowing users to seamlessly switch between light and dark modes. Because who doesn’t love a little customization in their life?

### 6. **Password History:**

Ever generated a great password, only to accidentally generate another one and lose the previous one? Not anymore. This project will include a password history feature, so you can easily recover previously generated passwords during your session.

### 7. **Custom Character Sets:**

Flexibility is the name of the game here. Users will have the option to customize the character set used to generate their passwords. Whether you want a password with only letters, specific symbols, or something else, this feature has got you covered.

### 8. **Responsive Design:**

In today’s world, accessibility is key. This project will feature a responsive design, ensuring it works beautifully on both mobile and desktop devices. No matter where you are, secure passwords are just a tap away.

### 9. **API Integration:**

This project wouldn’t be complete without seamless API integration. We’ll be using the password generator API from [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com) to fetch random passwords based on user input. Simple, efficient, and powerful.

### 10. **Unit Testing:**

As a nod to best practices, this project will include unit tests to ensure that the password generation logic works as expected. We want to ensure that you get a robust and reliable tool every time.

### 11. **Comprehensive Documentation:**

Finally, the project will feature detailed documentation. Whether you're a user looking to understand how to use the generator, or a developer wanting to contribute, the documentation will have everything you need.
